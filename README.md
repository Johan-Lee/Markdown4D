# Markdown4D

Markdown4D is a CommonMark / GFM markdown library written in Delphi. It parses
markdown into a typed AST, renders HTML, writes markdown back out, and ships
custom-drawn viewer and editor components for VCL and FMX. Everything is plain
Object Pascal on top of the RTL; rendering happens on a canvas, without an
embedded browser.

*Markdown4D Studio, the editor example, in the light and the dark theme. Source
on the left, `TMarkdownEditor`; rendered document on the right,
`TMarkdownViewer`. The table, the bar chart, the flowchart and the highlighted
code are all drawn on the canvas from the markdown you see next to them.*

## Why Markdown4D

Markdown is a handy way to give plain text a visual shape, and Delphi had no
component that rendered it well, at runtime or on the form designer. So we
built one, starting from a parser rather than a shortcut: Markdown4D passes
all 652 official CommonMark examples, and the library is interface-based
throughout, handing you a typed `IMarkdownDocument` rather than a string of
HTML.

VCL and FMX are both supported, with no external dependencies. Charts, mermaid
diagrams and LaTeX formulas are drawn natively, alongside the usual markdown
constructs: tables, task lists, links, raw HTML.

The pipeline builder accepts inline and block syntax of your own. The renderer
turns a document into HTML, the writer turns it back into markdown, so a round
trip through the tree gets you clean markdown out the other end. And it
streams, if that is what you need.

An incremental parser reparses only the region that changed. That is what
makes streaming practical: a log that grows, an import reporting as it runs, a
model answering a token at a time. It is also what keeps an editor responsive
on a large document.

Everything under `Source\` was written for this project and uses only the RTL:
no DLL of its own, no package manager involved. Delphi 12 Athens and Delphi
13, MIT licensed.

## Features

| Area | What you get |
|------|-------------|
| CommonMark 0.31.2 + GFM | 652/652 official examples; tables, task lists, strikethrough, extended autolinks |
| Public AST | Typed node interfaces, a visitor, and a round-trip writer back to clean markdown |
| Incremental parser | Reparses only the changed region, which is what keeps an editor fast and a stream practical |
| VCL & FMX viewer and editor | One API on both frameworks: theming, selection, find, syntax-highlighted source, a live preview |
| Chart extension | `chart` fences drawn natively: bar, line, pie, doughnut, radar, scatter |
| Mermaid extension | `mermaid` fences drawn natively: flowchart, sequence, pie |
| Math | `$...$` and `$$` blocks set on the canvas: fractions, roots, limits, matrices, stretchy delimiters; `\(...\)` HTML for KaTeX and MathJax |
| Raw HTML in the viewer | The allowed subset renders through the ordinary path; `<script>` and `<style>` are dropped with their content |
| Extension API | Block/inline parsers, delimiter processors, renderer hooks, document processors, block overrides |

The document builder, the table of contents, the HTML renderer's safety modes
and the SVG engine are documented in [docs/API.md](docs/API.md).

## Quick start

Markdown to HTML:

```pascal
uses
  Markdown4D;

const Html = TMarkdown.ToHtml('# Hello *world*');
```

`ToHtml` renders safely: raw HTML is omitted and scripting destinations such as
`javascript:` are emptied. For byte-for-byte specification output on input you
trust, use `TMarkdown.ToUnsafeHtml`.

A configured pipeline (GFM, raw HTML allowed):

```pascal
uses
  Markdown4D.Pipeline,
  Markdown4D.Extensions.Interfaces;

const Html = TMarkdownPipeline.Create
  .UseGfm
  .UnsafeHtml
  .Build
  .ToHtml(Source);
```

A viewer on a VCL form:

```pascal
uses
  Markdown4D.Theme,
  Markdown4D.Vcl.Viewer;

const Viewer = TMarkdownViewer.Create(Self);
Viewer.Parent := Self;
Viewer.Align := alClient;
Viewer.ThemePreset := TMarkdownThemePreset.Dark;
Viewer.Text := '# Welcome'#10#10 + 'This is **Markdown4D**.';
```

Text that arrives in pieces. The viewer reparses incrementally, debounces
relayout and follows the tail:

```pascal
procedure TReportForm.OnChunkReceived(const Chunk: string);
begin
  FViewer.AppendMarkdown(Chunk);
end;
```

A chunk may split a word, a `**bold**` span, a fenced block or a table row; the
incremental parser reconciles it when the next chunk completes it. That covers a
log that grows, an import that reports as it runs, a document assembled on the
fly, and a model that answers token by token.

`AppendMarkdown` is safe to call from a worker thread; it marshals to the UI
thread for you. See [docs/STREAMING.md](docs/STREAMING.md).

  <img src="docs/images/streaming-demo.gif" alt="Markdown4D Studio with the markdown source on the left and the live preview on the right, text arriving a chunk at a time while a table, a native bar chart and a mermaid flowchart take shape" width="90%">
</p>

*The same thing running: source on the left, live preview on the right, text
arriving a chunk at a time. The chart and the diagram appear as their fences
close. Nothing here is a browser, and the animation itself is rendered by the
library through `tools\Make-Demo.ps1` rather than captured off a screen.*

## Installation

Markdown4D ships as source, all of it, under the MIT licence. Add these folders
to your project:

```
Source\Core     framework-neutral parser, AST, renderer, writer, extensions
Source\Layout   framework-neutral layout engine, theme, viewer/editor models,
                rasterizer, SVG engine
Source\Vcl      VCL painter, viewer, editor
Source\Fmx      FMX painter, viewer, editor
```

If you only render to HTML, `Source\Core` is all you need.

For the design-time components, build the packages in `packages\` and install
the two design packages in the IDE. The full instructions are in
[packages/INSTALL.md](packages/INSTALL.md).

## Examples

The `Examples\` folder contains four runnable projects:

| Project | Framework | Shows |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| `Markdown4DStudioVCL` | VCL | Editor + live preview + table of contents, with native charts, mermaid diagrams and formulas |
| `StreamingMarkdownVCL` | VCL | Text streamed into a chat-style window: incremental render, async images, live charts, diagrams and formulas |
| `Markdown4DStudioFMX` | FMX | Editor + live preview, with native charts, mermaid diagrams and formulas |
| `StreamingMarkdownFMX` | FMX | The same streaming window on FireMonkey, with live charts, diagrams and formulas |

## Architecture

Markdown4D is strictly layered. `Core` and `Layout` are framework-neutral; only
the outermost layer knows about VCL or FMX.

```
             +----------------------+      +----------------------+
   VCL app   |  Source\Vcl          |      |  Source\Fmx          |  FMX app
             |  Painter / Viewer    |      |  Painter / Viewer    |
             |  Editor              |      |  Editor              |
             +----------+-----------+      +-----------+----------+
                        |                              |
                        +---------------+--------------+
                                        |
                  +---------------------v---------------------+
                  |  Source\Layout                            |  framework-neutral
                  |  Layout engine, display list, theme,      |
                  |  hit-testing, viewer and editor models,   |
                  |  block overrides (charts, mermaid)        |
                  +---------------------+---------------------+
                                        |
                  +---------------------v---------------------+
                  |  Source\Core                              |  framework-neutral
                  |  Parser (blocks and inlines), incremental |
                  |  parser, AST, HTML renderer, markdown     |
                  |  writer, TOC, extensions, pipeline        |
                  |  builder                                  |
                  +-------------------------------------------+
```

A single string of markdown flows through
`source → pipeline → AST → (HTML renderer | markdown writer | layout engine → display list → painter)`.

## Conformance dashboard

The suite runs the CommonMark and GFM specification corpora plus round-trip and
incremental parsing corpora on every build. The table below is regenerated by
`build.bat`.

<!-- conformance:start -->
| Corpus | Test cases | Passed | Pass rate |
|--------|-----------:|-------:|----------:|
| CommonMark | 26 | 26 | 100.0% |
| Gfm | 5 | 5 | 100.0% |
| Math | 19 | 19 | 100.0% |
| RoundTrip | 31 | 31 | 100.0% |
| Incremental | 63 | 63 | 100.0% |
| **Total** | **144** | **144** | **100.0%** |
<!-- conformance:end -->

A test case runs a group of specification examples rather than a single one, so
the counts above are groups. The CommonMark corpus behind them covers all 652
official examples of version 0.31.2, the GFM corpus covers the extension
examples, and the math corpus covers the `$` syntax.

## Building & testing

Run the build script from the repository root:

```bat
build.bat
```

It compiles and runs the DUnitX main and FMX test suites, builds every example
and every package, and regenerates the conformance dashboard above.

## Documentation

  the `==mark==` parser extension, an admonition custom-rendering walkthrough
  on the `IExtensionCanvas`, and the bundled chart and mermaid extensions.
- [docs/STREAMING.md](docs/STREAMING.md) is the streaming integration guide:
  `AppendMarkdown`, debounce, threading, charts and `Text` semantics.
- [packages/INSTALL.md](packages/INSTALL.md) describes the package build and
  the IDE install.

## Third-party code

No third-party code. Every line under `Source\` is written for this project,
including the anti-aliased polygon rasterizer, the SVG engine and the formula
layout engine behind the viewers.

One font travels with it. `Source\Fonts\STIXTwoMath-Regular.otf` is STIX Two
Math by the STIX Fonts project, under the SIL Open Font License 1.1
(`Source\Fonts\OFL.txt`). The VCL and FMX packages compile it in as a resource;
an application installs it for its own process by adding
`Markdown4D.Vcl.MathFont` or `Markdown4D.Fmx.MathFont` to a uses clause, as the
examples do. Leave that unit out and formulas use the math font the platform
ships with, Cambria Math on Windows and STIX Two Math on macOS.

Two things an SVG needs from the machine it runs on, glyph outlines and image
decoding, are reached through seams. The system font engine and the VCL picture
classes answer them on Windows, and FMX answers them everywhere it runs, so the
library itself adds nothing to what you deploy.

One footnote, because it is visible in the build output: the FMX examples set
`GlobalUseSkia := True`, which switches FireMonkey to its Skia canvas for
accurate text metrics in the editor and brings `sk4d.dll` along. That is a
choice of those examples, not a requirement of Markdown4D. The VCL examples ship
as a single executable.

The specification corpora under `Tests\specs` come from the CommonMark and GFM
specifications; see [Tests/specs/README.md](Tests/specs/README.md) for their
origin and licence.
